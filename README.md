# Airline Data Warehouse Project

## Overview

This project involves the creation of a data warehouse for an airline company, including the creation of a source database, generating data for the source, designing the data warehouse schema, and creating an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. The goal is to centralize and organize airline-related data to facilitate efficient analysis and reporting.

## Components

1. **Source Database Creation**: Setting up a PostgreSQL database as the source database to store raw airline data, including flight details, passenger information, and other relevant data.

2. **Data Generation for Source**: Generating simulated data or extracting real data to populate the source database, ensuring it reflects the operational aspects of the airline business.

3. **Data Warehouse Schema Design**: Designing the schema for the data warehouse, including defining tables, relationships, and data types to organize and structure the data effectively for analysis.

4. **ETL Pipeline Creation**: Developing an ETL pipeline using Talend (or other ETL tools) to extract data from the source database, transform it according to the data warehouse schema, and load it into the data warehouse.

## Tools Used

- **PostgreSQL**: For creating the source database and storing raw airline data.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing tasks.
- **Talend**: For designing and implementing the ETL pipeline to move data from the source database to the data warehouse.

## Project Workflow

1. **Source Database Setup**: Create tables in PostgreSQL to store raw airline data, ensuring appropriate indexing and data integrity constraints.

2. **Data Generation**: Populate the source database with simulated or real data, covering various aspects of airline operations such as flights, passengers, tickets, and crew.

3. **Data Warehouse Schema Design**: Design the schema for the data warehouse, considering factors such as data normalization, denormalization, and performance optimization.

4. **ETL Pipeline Development**: Develop Talend jobs to extract data from the source database, perform necessary transformations, and load it into corresponding tables in the data warehouse.

5. **Testing and Validation**: Test the ETL pipeline to ensure data accuracy, completeness, and consistency between the source database and the data warehouse.

6. **Deployment and Maintenance**: Deploy the ETL pipeline to production and establish a maintenance plan for ongoing data updates, schema modifications, and performance tuning.

## Conclusion

The airline data warehouse project aims to centralize and organize airline-related data for efficient analysis and reporting purposes. By leveraging PostgreSQL, Pandas, NumPy, and Talend, the project aims to streamline the ETL process and provide stakeholders with valuable insights into airline operations.
